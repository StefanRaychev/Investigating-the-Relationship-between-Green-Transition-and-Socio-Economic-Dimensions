# Investigating-the-Relationship-between-Green-Transition-and-Socio-Economic-Dimensions

The complex relationship between green transition and socio-economic factors implies a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the interdependencies between the indicators. The employment and unemployment variables will be particularly affected. Amounting research shows that the transformation to "green" jobs, if not supported by adequate policies, will put the labour market at risk. On the one hand, the need for new skills means higher public costs, and on the other hand, the drive to reduce carbon emissions, if not accompanied by unemployment control, will also put economic growth at risk. This implies a gradual transformation of the countries, which in turn requires updated social and fiscal pacts. Such countries must be adapted to the future, must tackle modern risk structure, must ensure the expansion of the scope of rights and urgently face the challenges of low productivity, social vulnerability and inequality, institutional weakness and technological and climate change.
